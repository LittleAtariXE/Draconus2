    <h2> ABOUT </h2>
    <h4> I created this project primarily to gain a better understanding of how network sockets work in Python, and also as a fun exploration of Processes and Threads. After many, many... hours of work and testing with network sockets, I can only say one thing: "You can get a serious brain workout!" ðŸ˜„ </h4>
    <h4> However, it seems to me that I've managed to create servers and clients that, to some extent, can work together (recover connections, avoid hanging, etc.). Nevertheless, strange "things" can still happen, and network sockets may behave in quite peculiar ways. </h4>
    <h4> In any case, I invite you to test and improve this project, as someone else might be able to tame those "network sockets." Good luck!</h4>

    <h2> What is "Draconus"? </h2>
    <h4> Draconus is a background-running program. Through another program called "Command Center," we connect to Draconus. Draconus enables the creation of various types of servers. These servers run as separate processes in the background but remain dependent on Draconus. As long as Draconus is running, all servers created by us will keep running.</h4>  
    <h4> The advantage of this setup is that you can safely disconnect from Draconus (using the Command Center), and it will continue to run alongside the servers as "Daemon Processes" in the system. </h4>  
    <h4> Draconus allows you to create an unlimited number of servers (I mean, I didn't introduce any limitations) until your CPU explodes! ðŸ˜„ Each server is capable of handling connections from multiple clients simultaneously, managing those connections, receiving and sending messages or commands. Feel free to test the endurance of the servers, i.e., how many clients they can handle simultaneously and communicate with.</h4>  
    <h4> You're welcome to test and see how robust these servers are! </h4>

  <h2> How Draco Works </h2>
  <h4>Due to its nature, Draconus operates exclusively on the Linux operating system. Because of its use of the Python `multiprocessing` module, this program may not function properly on Windows. However, client-type programs created using Draconus for connecting to servers are compatible with all systems that have Python installed.</h4>

  <h4>To run Draconus, you execute it as a background process (e.g., by using the "nohup" command). Draconus and every server it creates run continuously in the background as separate processes, each having its own log file.</h4>


<h4> **Each server has its own separate log file** and features a "Messenger" responsible for communication with users and logging server events. When working with Draconus, you can see its messages and those of the servers in real-time (courtesy of Messenger). When you disconnect from Draconus, Messenger continues to log messages to the file while buffering them. Upon reconnecting to Draconus, you'll receive all the pending messages that have accumulated since your last connection.</h4>
<h4>Therefore, even when you're not currently connected to Draconus, you can review messages and events by examining the continuously updated log file.</h4>
<h4>With Draconus, you connect using the Command Center. Command Center makes use of the "click" and "click-shell" libraries, providing you with a command-line interface with commands, parameters, and help. The console has two levels. The first level is where you interact with Draconus, creating servers, starting, closing, exporting, and performing other actions. The second console level operates after connecting to a previously created server. Each server may have slightly different commands, depending on its specifications (a "help" command is always available with a list of commands). From this level, you can also send messages and commands to connected clients on the server.</h4>
<h4>Draconus generates ready-to-use clients for each server; all you need to do is start them. Messages sent between clients and the server are not yet fully encrypted (I'm working on it), and they currently undergo a simple message format transformation to "Base64." Special messages are additionally padded with randomly generated character strings (similar to headers) to confuse potential eavesdroppers. Of course, everything is configurable, but if you don't want to delve into the details, you don't have to. Draconus is designed to work very well with default settings. The only thing you need to set in the configuration is your IP address, which can be found in the "CONFIG.py" file.</h4>
<h4>Draconus can also be started as a regular program using the command "python3 Draconus.py." In this case, you'll need to open a second terminal to run the "Command Center."</h4>

**Python Libraries Used in Draconus:**
<h4>Jinja2</h4>
<h4>Click</h4>
<h4>Click-Shell</h4>

<h4>Clients created by Draconus only require pure Python, with no additional libraries.</h4>

<div id="install">
  <h3 align="center">Installation</h3>

  **Basic Requirements:**

- Linux Operating System (tested on Parrot and Kali)
- Python 3.9

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LittleAtariXE/Draconus2
   ```
2. Change directory
   ```sh
   cd Draconus2
   ```
3. Install requirements
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

  <h3 align="center">First Run</h3>

   **First steps:**
   
1. Navigate to the "Draconus" directory using the command:
  ```sh
  cd Draconus2
  ```

2. Use the `nohup` command to run programs in the background. Execute the command:
  ```sh
  nohup python3 Draconus.py &
  ```
3. After starting Draconus, a directory named "DRACONUS" will be created in its folder. This directory will store log files, payloads, and the client programs created by Draconus.
   When you run the command `ps aux | grep python3`, you should see the "Draconus" process in the list of active processes, indicating that it is running in the background. If you wish, you can explore the "DRACONUS/OUTPUT" directory where log files are located, allowing you to review them in real-time.
